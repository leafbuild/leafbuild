# Setup

Most developer actions are managed as make recipes by [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make);
to install it, follow [the guide in the readme](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make#installation).

They are described in the `Makefile.toml` file at the root of the repository.
For a list of them all and what each does, see [root makefile recipes](root_makefile_recipes.md).
